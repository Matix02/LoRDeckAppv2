# Legends of Runeterra Deck Tracker[In Progress] 
Application for hand-storing decks from the Legends of Runetarra card game.

Decks are consist of the choice of a fraction, title, description. After adding a new deck, the user can add a win or a loss to determine the deck to calculate the win percentage and not remember which deck is the best. The list comes from the Cloud Firebase database and the changes are immediately visible on the screen. Each deck can be edited using the Formik API, same as by adding. But adding is build by Modal Screen, opposite to the edditing of deck which is by supported by different page.
